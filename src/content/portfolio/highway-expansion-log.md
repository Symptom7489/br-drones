### The Challenge
With high-speed traffic adjacent to the job site, the client faced significant liability risks. They needed a verifiable daily record of traffic control (cones, barriers, signage) to protect against false accident claims.

### The Solution
We implemented a weekly flight schedule to produce high-resolution orthomosaic maps. These maps provide a time-stamped "truth" of the site conditions every 7 days.

### The Results
* **Legal Protection:** Permanent visual record of OSHA-compliant traffic control.
* **Stakeholder Transparency:** Stakeholders can view 3D progress without a site visit.
* **Subcontractor Verification:** Verified earthwork volumes against site plans.
