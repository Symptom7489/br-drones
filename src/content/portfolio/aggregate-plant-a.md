### The Challenge
The client was manually estimating stockpile volumes, leading to a ±12% inventory discrepancy at year-end audits.

### The Solution
We performed an automated flight mission capturing 450 high-res images, processed via photogrammetry to create a centimeter-accurate 3D model.

### The Results
* **Accuracy:** Improved to ±0.5%.
* **Safety:** Zero man-hours spent climbing unstable piles.
* **Time:** Full site audit completed in 45 minutes vs. 2 days.
