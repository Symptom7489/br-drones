### The Challenge
A high-value listing was struggling to gain traction because its most unique feature—a private dock and 500ft of river frontage—was invisible from the street.

### The Solution
We produced a "Cinematic Narrative" video, starting with a low-altitude sweep of the driveway and transitioning into a sweeping aerial reveal of the riverfront.

### The Results
* **Engagement:** 400% increase in Zillow listing views within 48 hours.
* **Perspective:** Clearly documented the property lines and neighbor proximity for out-of-state buyers.
* **Emotional Connection:** Used professional color grading to evoke a "lifestyle" feel.
