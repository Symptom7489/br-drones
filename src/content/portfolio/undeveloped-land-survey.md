### The Challenge
A commercial buyer needed to assess 40 acres of heavily wooded land for utility access and drainage issues without the expense of a full ground crew.

### The Solution
Using high-altitude aerial perspective and neighborhood analysis, we identified existing utility markers and mapped water retention areas after a rain event.

### The Results
* **Cost Savings:** Identified "dead zones" for building before a traditional survey was ordered.
* **Efficiency:** 40-acre assessment completed in a single afternoon.
* **Visual Data:** Provided 4K video of surrounding traffic flow and neighboring business proximity.
